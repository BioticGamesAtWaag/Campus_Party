## Lasercutting remarks
At Waag we use the BRM1612 laser with lasercut5.3[BRM sofware]

### Laser cutter settings
* MDF CUT: speed 30, power 100, corner speed 25
* MDF ENGRAVE: speed 350, power 40
* Acrylic CUT: speed 50, power 90, corner speed 25 
* Double-sided tape CUT: speed 300, power 40, corner speed 25 

### problems + fixes:
* Sometimes the filesize scales wrongly in the lasercutter sofware
* Fix: select all, check dimensions in Inkscape, and rescale image on lasercutter sofware
